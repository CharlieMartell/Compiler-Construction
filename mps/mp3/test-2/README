This is a place for you to put test .cl files for Phase 2.  The
Makefile is set up so that you can compile .cl files through your code
generator (cgen-2) to generate executable code.  We put a Cool
sample file here for you to use.  You should write your own tests.
More tests will be provided a few days before due date.
